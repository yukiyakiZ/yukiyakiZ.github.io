[Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.4.0.html) is a quite powerful JS library to make an interactive map.
Compared with GoogleMap API, it is fully free and open source.
I used it to make a map of my footprint.

<!-- Dont allow map out of range vertically \TODO -->

<body onLoad="javascript:init();">
   <center><div id="map" style="height: 500px; width: 500px"></div></center>
</body>
