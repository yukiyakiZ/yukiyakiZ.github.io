I happened to find the lines in [fortune cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_cookie) to be sometimes stimulating, especially, after being exhausted by the ongoing task.
They are typically provided by Chinese retaurants in Berkeley alongside the meal.

>A problem well-stated is a problem half-solved.  - Proverb of a random fortune cookie I got

With this mindset, I also found the Vim plugin [Startify](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-startify) that provides a starting screen with customized set of quotes (configured in `~/.vim/bundle/vim-startify/autoload/startify/fortune.vim`). 
These sayings are helpful to refresh the mind and reflect on one's previous practices.
