<p>
  I will be starting the Ph.D. at Upenn CIS with <a href="http://vincen.tl">Prof. Vincent Liu</a> this fall.
  Before Penn, I sampled <del>random</del> experiences of networks during the concurrent master program as a late starter.
I <i><strong>care about</strong></i> networked systems broadly with a problem-oriented mindset. 
I am attracted by the inherently multi-disciplinary nature of networked systems domain and I am devoted to such broad landscape during the Ph.D. trajectory and beyond.
    <!-- I am self-motivated to explore the problem end-to-end and pick up the knowledge both in <em>theory</em> and <em>practice</em> to get the things done. -->
