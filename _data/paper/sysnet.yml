- name: Rethinking End-to-End Congestion Control in Software-Defined Networks
  venue: HotNets ’12
  problem: TCP is a “Jack of all trades, master of none” protocol, which can not adapt to the diverse set of networks with different characteristics and traffic conditions.
  solution: OpenTCP leverages the centralized oracle to monitor the network dynamic states and adapt the distributed TCP agents (e.g., change the TCP variants) on the fly.
  note: The main highlight of the paper is to bridge SDN abstraction together with congestion control.
- name: Core-Stateless Fair Queueing - A Scalable Architecture to Approximate Fair Bandwidth Allocations in High Speed Networks
  venue: ToN '03 
  problem: Existing fair queueing mechanisms require significant implementation complexity including the per-flow state maintenance which hinder its wide adoption.
  solution: The solution distinguishes the edge routers (maintain per-flow states) and the core routers (no per flow state) given a contiguous island of routers.
    Inspired by the bit-by-bit bufferless fluid model, the papers points out the key to achieve max-min fairness is to apply a probabilistic dropping algorithm 
    based on the information of flow rates and fair share rates.
    Considering that the transmission in the realworld is packetized, the design allocates the flow rates estimation to edge routers (information is labeled into packets) 
    and the fair share rates estimation to core routers which performs FIFO scheduling + probabilistic dropping.
    The paper proposes rewriting scheme for multihop situations.
    The approximate fair queueing solution also provides a worst case bound.
  note: The architecture design strikes a balance between stateless and stateful network core.
- name: Fast Network Simulation Through Approximation or- How Blind Men Can Describe Elephants
  venue: HotNets '18
  problem: It is difficult to evaluate a data center proposal due to the prohibitive costs/risks of testbed deployment and low speed of large-scale packet-level DES.
  solution: Inspired by the global climate modeling, the paper partitions the big system (data center) into manageable sub-regions (create abstractions and interfaces to reduce the complexity) to be approximated with ML models (replace packet event processing with inference of ML models). It will allow us to balance the trade-offs between the computation time and the fidelity.
  note: It is an important problem since it will advance the nurture of innovative ideas in networking research, given that simulation techniques will still play significant roles of experimenting ideas. The paper captures the fundamental complaint from network simulation practitioners that we always have to scale down the workload, network in order to conduct feasible pipeline. Data centers are also the suitable playground to target at due to the hierarchical/recursive structure and the scale.
- name: Internet Congestion Control via Deep Reinforcement Learning
  problem: A dumbbell topology example to illustrate that congestion control is complex -- uncoordinated, decentralized rate selection; obliviousness to other contending connections, network policies; dynamic network environment (latencies, link capacities); different congestion control protocols...
  solution: The authors argue that with DRL + congestion control, we could have the best of both worlds (generic/robust + context-specific).
  note: The details of DRL solution is clear, however, the contribution is trivial since it is just a direct plugin of DRL + congestion control (which is also not new).
- name: Music-Defined Networking
  venue: HotNets '18
  problem: Existing inband and out-of-band (e.g., WiFi management networks) network orchestration techniques suffer from several limitations, such as the great complexity of management traffic and cost.
  solution: The novel approach leverages sounds to conduct datacenter server fan failure detection, heavy hitter flow detection and so on. The basic idea is to analyse the sounds generated by network devices that are programmed to actively emit a certain sound (or sound sequences encoding information) in response to an event or passive sounds with signal processing techniques (FFT, spectrogram) for detection, information decoding and so forth.
  note: As the paper points out, the solution suffers in practice from the flexibility in device placement due to the significant signal degradation.
- name: Information-Centric Networking - Seeing the Forest for the Trees
  venue: HotNets '11
  problem: Voluminous papers are focusing on the trees, i.e., proposing the proposals for data-oriented or content-centric network architectures without seeing the forest, i.e., questioning the real value of this approach to networking. 
  solution: The paper identifies the commonalities and differences among these proposals and investigates several research issues. 
  note: This is a paper that brings clarity -- what benefits do we think ICN designs offer, and are ICN designs the best way to achieve those benefits? It brings awareness of the fact that we are actually blindly pursueing the former without asking the latter.
- name: Why is the Internet so slow?!
  venue: PAM '17
  problem: In today’s Internet, the latencies are typically around one and two orders of magnitude larger than the lower bound implied by the speed of light. 
  solution: This measurement paper (interestingly, it also crowdsources via MOOC-recruited end users) investigates why are we so far from the speed of light and reveals the main culprits such as the Internet’s infrastructural inefficiencies, protocol overheads and so forth. 
  note: The paper brings awareness of the current situation of the Internet latencies and proposes the grand new challenge for the research community - building a speed-of-light Internet.
- name: A Control-Theoretic Approach for Dynamic Adaptive Video Streaming over HTTP
  venue: SIGCOMM ’15
  problem: We want a robust bitrate adaptation algorithm in client-side players to ensure a good user-perceived quality-of-experience (QoE).
  solution: The paper formulates a rigor control-theoretic model of the bitrate adaptation problem with a practical MPC algorithm.
  note: This encouraing work provides details on how to formulate a decision making problem in computer networks to a control problem, how to turn the control methods into practical implementation, and how to evaluate such approaches systematically.
- name: Active Network Vision and Reality - Lessons from a Capsule-based System
  venue: SOSP’99
  problem: There is an active debate on active networks in the research community yet there has been little hard evidence to inform this debate.

  note: Self-contained with comprehensive details regarding the bootstrapping knowledge, design, (incremental) deployment.
